Michael goes to his website and is so enamored by the content and impressive body of work that he watches the video embedded into the site, explaining who Julian is and what he does. As he is browsing, Michael discovers the AR app that Julian has produced along with his resume and portfolio. Michael sends Julian's resume and portfolio to his hiring managers to be reviewed and follows Julian on social media. Julian posts that he'll be hosting a meet and greet Livestream for Michael to get to know him and understand some of his work. In the interim, further social media posts stating that additional projects and accomplishments are available for viewing on his site. Michael then prepares to attend the Livestream event and prepares his questions accordingly...</p>
